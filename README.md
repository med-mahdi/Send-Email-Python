#  Create & use app passwords
Important: To create an app password, you need 2-Step Verification on your Google Account.

If you use 2-Step-Verification and get a "password incorrect" error when you sign in, you can try to use an app password.

### Go to your Google Account.
### Select Security.
### Under "Signing in to Google," select 2-Step Verification.
### At the bottom of the page, select App passwords.
### Enter a name that helps you remember where you’ll use the app password.
### Select Generate.
### To enter the app password, follow the instructions on your screen. The app password is the 16-character code that generates on your device.
### Select Done.

If you’ve set up 2-Step Verification but can’t find the option to add an app password, it might be because:

Your Google Account has 2-Step Verification set up only for security keys.
You’re logged into a work, school, or another organization account.
Your Google Account has Advanced Protection.
